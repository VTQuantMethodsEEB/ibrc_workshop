## Introducing Tidyverse
- the tidyverse is a powerful set of separate packages
- https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/
- powerful packages within the tidyverse include:
-  dplyr (management & manipulation)
-  tidyr (cleaning)
- stringr (dealing with words inside columns)
- [lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) (dealing with dates/times)

## Tidy(ing) data

Hadley Wickham has defined a concept of [tidy
data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper), and has
introduced the `tidyverse` package.

-   Each variable is in a column
-   Each observation is in a row
-   "Long" rather than "wide" form
-   Sometimes duplicates data
-   Statistical modeling tools and graphical tools (especially the
    **ggplot2** package) in R work best with long form
    
## An example of tidy data
```{r, out.width = "800px",echo=F}
knitr::include_graphics("tidy_pic.png")
```

## Putting your data in tidy format
- Discerning what is a variable can be hard when making data files
- For example, species in my bat dataset is usually a single variable
- I usually also include a "count" column (the number of individuals at a site)
- But what if I wanted to test the effect of the count of one species (e.g.MYSE)
  on another? 
- I'd need to rearrange

## Piping
- tidyverse syntax is VERY different from base R
- it relies on using `%>%`
- this is called a pipe
- it says the word "then"

## First load the package
```{r load_tidyverse}
#install if you don't have it
library(tidyverse)
```

## Example
```{r}
iris %>%
# This says take the 'built-in' dataset iris
  # THEN filter just the iris species == setosa
  filter(Species=="setosa")

  
```

## Critical tools for managing data in tidyverse

- `pivot_longer`, `pivot_wider`
- `mutate`: add a column
- `select`: select columns
- `filter`: select rows
- `group_by`: group then do something (usually mutate or summarise)
- `summarise`: make a summary table
- `arrange`: sort
- `left_join`: merge [see other `join` options](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html)

## Read in two datasets
- you will need to tell R where to find them on your computer

- I am using an .Rproj file, which sets my working directory 

- https://github.com/VTQuantMethodsEEB/ibrc_workshop/tree/main/data_management

## First read in batdat, each row is a bat

```{r load_batdat, echo=T}
# in this dataset, each row is a bat that 
# is positive or negative for P. destructans
batdat = read.csv("bat_data.csv")
head(batdat)

```

## Then, read in batcount, each row is a site
```{r load_bat_count, echo=T}
# in this dataset, each row the count of hibernation site
# for a partcular species on a particular date
# even though sites were counted on the same date
# species are repeated across dates
batcount = read.csv("bat_count.csv")
head(batcount)


```


## Group by
 - `group_by` is my favorite tidyverse command which has cut my need to write loops in half
 - `group_by` allows you to do calculations on groups of things, for example, by species or year
- `group_by` is kind of like using Excel's `filter`
- For example, if I group_by `species, date`, this is the equivalent in Excel of selecting a species (e.g. MYLU) and a specific date (e.g. March 1 2016, 3/1/16) except group_by does this for every species and date combination in your dataset
- This is incredibly useful because in other programs, you might need to write a for loop to have this capability

## Group by species
```{r group_by_example}
batdat$lgdL = log10(batdat$gdL)
batdat %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
    summarise(mean.fungal.loads=mean(lgdL,na.rm=TRUE))
```

## Summarise versus Mutate
 - `summarise` creates a new dataframe 
 - `mutate` does a calculation where it add a new column to your existing dataframe
 
## Importance of assigning 
```{r}
fungal.load.table = batdat %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(mean.fungal.loads=mean(lgdL,na.rm=TRUE))

fungal.load.table

```

## Assigning
- When using summarise, it's best to call your summarised object a new name (e.g. fungal.load.table)
- This is typically not necessary when using mutate which just adds a column to an existing dataset
 
```{r mutate example}
batdat = batdat %>% 
  #take batdat, then group by somethings
  #we re-assign batdat to batdat because we want to add the column to that dataframe
    group_by(site,species,date) %>% 
  #you can group_by multiple things
    mutate(sample.size=n())
#this adds a column to the dataframe 
#using the function n(), which counts things (e.g n rows in the group)
```

## What does our dataframe look like now?
```{r looking at new dataframe}
head(batdat %>%
       select(c("swab_id", "site","species","date","gd","sample.size")))
#this is just showing a few columns for effect
```

## Joining
- Joining datasets together is a useful skill, especially if we have two datasets we need to match on a specific column or set of columns
- https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html
- Always call your new dataframe something new; don't write over and old dataframe in case you make a mistake joining

## Join functions
- `inner_join()`: includes all rows in x and y.
- when inner joining, non-matching rows will be dropped!
- `left_join()`: includes all rows in x.
- when left joining, every row in x is kept, but only those matching x are kept in y
- `right_join()`: includes all rows in y.
- when right joining, every row in y is kept, but only those matching y are kept in x
- `full_join()`: includes all rows in x or y.
- every row is kept in both x and y

## Joining actual datasets
- We frequently have data coming from different sources (lab, field, etc.)
- Let's join our infection data with our count data
- We might want to do this to ask 'How do bat infections at a site influence bat abundance at the same site?'

## Join batdat and batcount
```{r}
batdat_count = left_join(
  x = batdat,
  y = batcount,
  by = c("site","species","date")
  #columns to join on
)
head(batdat_count %>%
       select(c("swab_id","site","date","species","count")))
```
## Comparing to right_join to left_join
```{r}
count_fungal = right_join(
# using the fungal load table we create above
  x = fungal.load.table,
  y = batcount,
  by = c("species")
)
# this keeps only the rows in bat count
# we don't have a row for substrate, because we don't have
# a count for substrate

head(count_fungal)
```

## Pivoting
- https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html
- sometimes our datasets are not in the format we want for an analysis

## Why pivot?
```{r}
head(batdat_count)
# right now, species is in long format
# but we could imagine wanting to test the abundance of one species 
# and how that influences another
# for example, does the number of MYLU influence the number of MYSE?
# for that, we would need to make columns of each species count
# with a row for a site and a date

```


## `pivot_wider` is how we take long data, and make it wide
```{r}
batcounts.wide<- batcount %>% 
  #this says - make a new df called batcounts.wide using bat counts
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, 
              values_from = count
              ) 
##make columns for each of the values in the species column and fill those columns with values from the count column
head(batcounts.wide)
```


## adding 0s into a `pivot`
- when we perform this, it automatically fills missing with NAs but we know that missing actually mean 0
```{r}
batcounts.wide = batcount %>% 
  pivot_wider(
  names_from = species, 
  values_from = count,
  values_fill = 0
)
head(batcounts.wide)
```

## Going from wide to long format
- more often, we might be working in the opposite direction
- A more common issue is that programs output  information in columns that we would rather have in rows

```{r}

batcounts.long = batcounts.wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("EPFU","MYLU","MYSE","PESU"), 
    #what are the existing columns I want to make into rows?
    names_to =   "species",
    #put the names of the columns in a column called 'species'
    values_to = "count"
    #the values that were in each of the columns get moved to a column called 'count'
  )
```

## Check out new batcounts.long
```{r}
head(batcounts.long)

```


## Often, multiple ways to do the same thing
```{r}
#option #2
batcounts.long = batcounts.wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(starts_with("MY"), "EPFU", "PESU"),
    #if all the columns start with the same thing (or many of them)
    #we can use 'starts_with
    names_to =   "species",
    values_to = "count"
  )

```

## Option 3 - pivoting longer
```{r}
batcounts.long = batcounts.wide %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(site, date),
    #this says use every column but site and date
    names_to =   "species",
    values_to = "count"
  )
```
