## You have collected your data... now what? 
Now you are ready to work with your data in R!

* Important naming conventions
* Types of data R recognizes
  + how to work with dates
* Checking your data for errors
  + unique()
  + hist()
  + head()
  + summary()
  + plot()
  
## Read in your data
Please navigate to the below URL to access the data we will be using today:

https://github.com/VTQuantMethodsEEB/ibrc_workshop


## Read in your data
__read.csv()__ is the function to use when reading your spreadsheets into R. 

Using .csv files to store and read-in your data is important!

* Stores data in a text format (human-readable; transferrable)
* Can store large amounts of data in simple format
* Can be read by most programs

## Naming conventions
The R environment is very sensitive to how you name objects and slight differences are important.

* "Maple"
* " Maple"
* "maple"
* "maple "
* "maple."

Make sure your naming is consistent __in your .csv files!__

## Naming conventions
Additional good practices when naming things in R: 

* The names of R objects also have to start with a letter, not a number. 
* Use mostly numbers, underscores (_), and dots (.) in your names.
* Don't use potentially confusing names like I or O
* Don't use built-in names (like c, list, or data) for variables.
* Make readable variable names using camelCase, snake_case, or kebab.case
* Avoid variableNamesThatAreExcessivelyLong

## Data types
There are several types of data that R recognizes, listed below: 

* __Logical__: True/False data
* **Numeric**: All real numbers with or without decimal values
* **Integer**: Real numbers without decimal values. 
* **Character**: String data. Thing of this as any unique string of values, such as "1dkdl;" or "Apple_Pie". This is the default data type when R does not recognize data as being of another
type. 
* **Factor**: Used to describe items that can have a known set of values (species, habitat, etc.). Categorical variables, in statistical terms. 
* **Date**: calendar date, e.g. "10-22-1994"

## What type of data do we have? 

A quick way to check what kind of data we have in our dataframe is with the __str() function__

## Dates
Dates in R are notorious despite being common forms of data!

* Default format on Mac: mo/day/two digit year â€“ e.g. 01/13/18 is January 13, 2018
* Default format on PC: mo/day/four digit year - e.g. 01/13/2018

We can tell R to read our data as dates using __as.Date()__. 

## Dates: lubridate
'__Lubridate__' is a package built to make reading and changing date data easy. 

* Can turn numerical data into dates: 20101215 -> 2010-12-15
* Can quickly change format of dates with simple functions
* Helpful when extracting data from dates (for example, if you 
just want to extract month data from your dates)
* Useful when handling timezone differences. 

## Checking Data
__Checking your data is very important!__ R can only work with the data you give it -- make sure you're giving it good data. Check for common sources of falty data:

* Naming inconsistencies
  + Follow good naming conventions!
* Duplicated data
  + Are your repeating values real, or a product of a bug in your code? 
* Data that doesn't make sense biologically
  + A little brown bat weighing 72 grams whereas the others weighed around 7-8 grams probably
  isn't real! 
  
__Where should you correct your data?__

## Checking Data
Some useful tools in R to check your data for errors:

* head() -- gives you first rows of your dataframe
  + This is a good first pass
* unique() -- returns all of the unique values contained in a specified dataset
  + This is particularly useful when looking for naming inconsistencies
* hist() -- This will show you the frequency distribution of your specified data. 
  + Good for identifying anomalies or outliers in your data. __Interpret carefully!__

## Checking Data
Some useful tools in R to check your data for errors:

* summary() -- Returns summary statistics of your specified data. 
  + Again, good for identifying anomalies or outliers in your data. 
* Plot your data! 
  + plot() or ggplot() 
  + Visualize the shape of your data. Does something look off? 
  
## Checking Data
Check your data frequently! You should check your data when you:

* Read in its .csv file.
* Change the shape of your data.
* Merge datasets.
* Do calculations and make new datasets.  

## Version control
Using version control and management services will vastly reduce the chance
a serious error sneaks by. 

* **GitHub** (where you downloaded the data today) is a common code management
service.
  + Allows team members to collaborate on code.
  + Version control and track-changes.
  + Most journals today ask for your code, and GitHub repositories are a 
  common way for it to be published.
